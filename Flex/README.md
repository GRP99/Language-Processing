# Practical Work No. 1
## Flex

### Goals
This practical work had as main objectives:
* increase the experience of using the Linux environment and some programming support tools;
* increase the ability to write Regular Expressions (ER) for description of sentence patterns;
* develop, from ERs, systematically and automatically Regular Language Processors, which filter or transform texts based on the concept of Condition-Action production rules;
* use Flex to generate C text filters.

## Template multi-file
Tasks performed:
1. Specification of the sentence patterns you want to find in the source text, through ERs.
2. Identification of semantic actions to be performed in reaction to the recognition of each of these patterns.
3. Identification of global Data Structures that you may need to temporarily store the information that you extract from the source text or that you build as processing progresses.
4. Development of a Text Filter to recognize the identified patterns and carry out the desired transformation, using the FLex Generator.
